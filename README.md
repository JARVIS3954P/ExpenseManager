## üìä Progress So Far: **Database Schema & Model Classes**
### **üìù Implemented Model Classes**
The database schema follows **relational database principles** and is structured as follows:

|--------|-------------|
| **User** | One-to-Many with **Expense** |
| **Role** | Enum (`EMPLOYEE`, `MANAGER`, `ADMIN`) |
| **Expense** | Many-to-One with **User**, One-to-One with **FileAttachment** |
| **ExpenseCategory** | Enum (`TRAVEL`, `FOOD`, `OFFICE_SUPPLIES`, etc.) |
| **Approval Workflow** | One-to-One with **Expense**, Many-to-One with **User** (Approver) |
| **Audit Log** | Many-to-One with **User** |
| **Notification** | Many-to-One with **User** (Recipient) |
| **FileAttachment** | One-to-One with **Expense** (For invoices) |
